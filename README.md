# 3DPointCloud 

This Repository contains code for reconstructing 3D point clouds using the Occupancy Predictions of a small and sparse subsets of points.
This work is based on Lionar, Stefan, et al. "Dynamic Plane Convolutional Occupancy Networks" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference of Applications of Computer Vision, 2021.
